### Simple algorithm to draw your "lucky numbers"

### How to use
It's simple, just follow these five steps.

1. Open your terminal and enter in irb mode (I hope you already configured ruby in your machine before).

2. Copy the code inside the file in your terminal with irb.

3. After finish previous two step's, it's simple. Just call `lucky_numbers` method with these two arguments, `quantity` first (how many numbers you want draw) and `range` second (what range of numbers you want).
The command should be like following command: `lucky_numbers(6, 1..60)`.

That's it. "TA DA".
